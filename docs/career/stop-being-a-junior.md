# Stop being a junior

Hi, what follows are notes I've read about the following blog post.

Blog post: [Stop being a junior](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-being-a-junior)

An important characteristic of a junior dev is someone who just gets the boring repetitive tasks and simple bugs. You can be stuck in this mode for a long time, and the blog post provides a few tips to get out of it.

## Tech is fast

With so many technologies evolving so fast in today's world, a junior dev might not need as much as experience as a deveoper with decades of experience. One can jump into a new technology without having to worry about all that comes before it. This is not a critique about experienced software devs but more about the pace at which things are moving.

Most importantly, staying on top of certain technologies for a decent amount of time allows anyone to become an expert in them rather quickly.

## The junior moniker

Often, the "junior" moniker sticks with you and stops you from advancing in the field. You keep getting assigned smaller priority tasks. This can make you stuck. What follows are some tips to get past that moniker in the workplace and advance in the workplace.

One rather concise way of putting the points is, "Do what senior developers do in your company. Do that instead of what junior developers do". It's that simple.

- Request to sit in more important meetings, listen well, note down the new things you hear about and read about them later. This way you'll gain experience to be able to contribute more in the meetings that follow in the future.
- Don't overstep, but volunteer for more complicated tasks. Don't be overbearing and be respectful of people with more experience in the field than you as you keep your lack of experience in mind.
- Find someone who can sit down with you and fill in the gaps in your experience as you accumulate knowledge.
- Use fast-paced technology to your advantage and look at how you can leverage new trends in technology to improve projects in your company.
- Talk about what you've accomplished to demonstrate how you have contributed to work beyond wha they expect of a junior.
- Make sure your manager understands your goals and intentions as a developer. Keep them informed about how you expect to get to the next level, and discuss with them what it takes to get that promotion.

## Fake it till you make it

We talked about behaving like a senior software engineer, but it is not going to feel natural for some time. What you have to do is keep trying until this role feels natural to you. Try it till it fits :smile:
