# Welcome to my notes!

This is my attempt to make my notes available to myself and other people over the internet.

I like to take notes as I read up about various things within or beyond tech. While I forsee I will focus on tech in the near future, I might expand the scope of these notes to reviews, poems and... well... who knows?

For suggesting changes or improvements, feel free to add them [here](https://github.com/kkothari2001/notes-web/issues).
