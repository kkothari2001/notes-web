## A system for your finances

Looking after your finances is not a matter of choosing the perfect thing to invest in. It is a matter of building cashflows that allow you to support and sustain your lifestyle in the long run. A good system of cashflows provides you a safety net to protect you in case of emergencies (illness, job loss or death of a salary-earner). This allows you to simply get on with your life instead of remaining stuck and worried about money.

As suggested above, managing your money is not only about managing your investments, but also various types of insurance and making sure you have money in hand for any upcoming expenses. Even within investments, there are many ways you can divide up your money. Each investment product has their own purpose and one needs to understand exactly what each product is meant for.

Along the way, we clear out any jargon we often find in the world of investing.

## Cashflows

The first thing we need to do to start managing our money is to track it, because there are many ways in which we can receive money and many many more in which we can spend it all away. Some of these incomes/expenditures are regular while some are not. Demarcating the exact amounts of money you earn, spend and invest is important as it reduces your mental load of making frequent monetary decisions.

If you're someone who tends to overspend, marking off some part of your salary for investing and whisking it away to a seperate bank account before you can spend it may be a good idea. If you maintain 3 seperate bank accounts for saving, spending and another one where you get your income, you can move your money to the right spot in just 10 minutes after your salary drops. Figuring out exactly how much money you need in the spending account is something you need to slowly find out over a matter of 2-3 months.

Some good spending habits are:

<div style={{display:"flex", flexDirection:"column", alignItems:"center", width:"100%"}}>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Where you're putting your money</th>
        <th>% of your monthly take home income</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Living costs</td>
        <td>&lt; 45 - 50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>EMI Payouts</td>
        <td>&lt; 25 - 30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Savings</td>
        <td>&gt; 15 - 20%</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

## How to deal with the savings money

Once you have money to save, it is important to decide where and how to save the money. The money you save is not only for pure investment instruments, but you must also use it to insure your future.

Some common ways to allocate your savings are (this is not an exhaustive list):

- Emergency fund
- Health insurance
- Life insurance
- Short term investments
- Long term investments
- Retirement fund

We look at some of them in detail in the following subtopics and others in even more detail in future topics.
