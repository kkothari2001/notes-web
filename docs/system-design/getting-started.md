# Getting Started

Software design is the process of planning the structure and the make-up of the various parts of the software, such that it correctly and efficiently meets its requirements. It is one of the most important parts of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), and it provides a high-level overview of the software to be created.

## Phases of software design

- Architectural Design: Subsystems are identified
- Abstract Specifications: These subsystems are specified
- Interface Design: User Interface is designed. Defines how components interact with each other and how external users interact with the system.
- Component Design: Breaks down subsytems into further components
- Data and Algorithm Design: How the components actually work
